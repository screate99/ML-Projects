Report: Comparison of Classifier Performance for Bank Marketing Campaigns
Introduction
	In this practical application assignment, our goal is to compare the performance of four classifiers: k-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression (LR), decision trees (DT), and support vector machines (SVM). We will use a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository, which contains data from a Portuguese banking institution collected during multiple marketing campaigns. This analysis aims to identify the most effective classifier for predicting customer responses to marketing efforts.

Understanding the Business Problem
	The primary business problem is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of telemarketing campaigns by predicting which customers are likely to subscribe to a term deposit. By accurately identifying potential customers, the bank can target its marketing efforts more effectively, thereby reducing costs and increasing conversion rates.

Data Preparation
The dataset consists of various features such as age, job, marital status, education, default status, balance, housing loan, personal loan, and contact information. The target variable is whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (yes/no).

Steps Taken:
	Data Quality Check: Identified and handled missing data and duplicate records.
	Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and removed duplicates.
	Feature Engineering: Converted categorical variables to numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
	Normalization: Scaled numerical features to ensure they contribute equally to the model's performance.
	Feature Selection: Used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine the number of features needed to reach the predefined accuracy and Lasso regression to identify the top features.
	Train-Test Split: Divided the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
	Modeling and Evaluation : We implemented and evaluated the following classifiers on three different datasets:

		1. No records removed, no features removed.
		2. Duplicate records removed, outliers removed, unknown values imputed, and only top features kept.
		3. No records removed, only non-top features removed.
	We used GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for each model and then built the models to calculate their accuracy.

	Dataset 1: No Records Removed, No Features Removed
		Model	Train Time (s)	Train Accuracy	Test Accuracy
		Logistic Regression	931.73	0.9101	0.9162
		k-Nearest Neighbors	56.27	0.9099	0.9034
		Decision Tree	15.16	0.9363	0.9025
		Support Vector Machine	521.28	0.9055	0.9107

	Dataset 2: Duplicate Records Removed, Outliers Removed, Unknown Values Imputed, and Only Top Features Kept
		Model	Train Time (s)	Train Accuracy	Test Accuracy
		Logistic Regression	4.69	0.9103	0.9099
		k-Nearest Neighbors	25.31	0.9247	0.9087
		Decision Tree	4.96	0.9317	0.9044
		Support Vector Machine	317.54	0.9215	0.9132

	Dataset 3: No Records Removed, Only Non-Top Features Removed
		Model	Train Time (s)	Train Accuracy	Test Accuracy
		Logistic Regression	791.04	0.9100	0.9161
		k-Nearest Neighbors	56.88	0.9108	0.9012
		Decision Tree	14.06	0.9376	0.9092
		Support Vector Machine	472.60	0.9021	0.9040

Interpretation of Results
	Based on the evaluation metrics, Logistic Regression showed the highest accuracy for the dataset without removing duplicates, outliers, or handling "unknown" values, making it the best-performing classifier. KNN and Decision Trees also performed reasonably well but did not achieve the same level of precision and recall. SVM showed better accuracy on the dataset where duplicates and outliers were removed and "unknown" values were handled. Given the minor accuracy differences, it is more efficient to clean the data, resulting in fewer features (only nine) needed to train the model. The top features identified from the cleaned data provide valuable insights.

Actionable Insights and Recommendations
	Targeted Marketing: Utilize the Logistic Regression model to identify potential customers who are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit. This can significantly improve the efficiency of marketing campaigns.
	Data Quality Improvement: Provide more information for those marked as "unknown," as this may help improve data accuracy.
	Feature Importance: The most important features based on the current dataset are 'age', 'duration', 'campaign', 'pdays', 'previous', 'emp.var.rate', 'cons.price.idx', 'cons.conf.idx', and 'nr.employed'.
	Model Refinement: Continue identifying other models that may improve model accuracy.
Next Steps
	Implementation: Integrate the best-performing model into the bankâ€™s marketing systems to streamline targeting efforts.
	Continuous Monitoring: Regularly monitor model performance and retrain with new data to maintain accuracy and relevance.
	Exploration of Other Models: Consider exploring ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for potentially better performance.
